## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned Flexbox, how can I have a responsive design, and learned about the nth child of a class.

### Continued development

I struggle sometimes how to use flexbox, and I think I need to focus more on that.


### Useful resources
